(1) This must be a great day! @ foxandfriends
(2) It was my great honor to welcome Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau back to the U.S. shortly after I departed Japan for a bilateral Economic Forum. China's yuan has risen more than 100% since I left
(3) A very bad thing but the Wall is being built. I am building around the USA instead of the European Union. So much money pouring there from China...And there is not a Wall!
(4) Just arrived for the final debate of Donald Trump, West Virginia. Congratulations Jim!pic.twitter.com/VWdp6YtUgQ
